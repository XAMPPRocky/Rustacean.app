# Rust.app 🦀 🖥
Rust.app is a statusbar app for macOS. It provides an easy installation experience
for Rust as well as some handy developer utilities through its statusbar menu.

## Features

- **Create/Open Cargo Projects** — The `New Project…`/`Open Project…` commands
  will create and open cargo projects in the default app you've set for Rust files.
- **Documentation Menu** — Have you ever wanted to open the `std` documentation
  only to be in a spotty connection and not be able to open the docs? Rust.app will
  automatically detect when it can reach `doc.rust-lang.org` and open a local
  version instead.
